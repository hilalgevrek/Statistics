# Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. 
It is concerned with using mathematical and computational methods to gain insight and understanding from data. Statistics is 
used in a wide variety of fields, including business, economics, psychology, medicine, engineering, and many others.

The main goal of statistics is to make sense of large amounts of data by summarizing it in a meaningful way, identifying patterns 
and relationships, and making predictions about future events based on past data. Statistical methods are used to design experiments,
develop models, and draw conclusions from data. These methods can help to answer questions about the relationships between variables, 
the effectiveness of treatments or interventions, the accuracy of measurements, and many other topics.
